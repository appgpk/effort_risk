   <strong>Ellis Park by Helen Hoyt </strong><br><br><br>
    Little park that I pass <br>
    through, I carry off a piece <br>
    of you Every morning <br>
    hurrying down To my <br>
    work-day in the town; Carry <br>
    you for country there <br>
    To make the city ways <br>
    more fair. I take your trees, <br>
    And your <br>
    breeze, Your <br>
    greenness, <br>
    Your cleanness, <br>
    Some of your shade, some of your <br>
    sky, Some of your calm as I go by; <br>
    Your flowers to <br>
    trim The <br>
    pavements grim; <br>
    Your space for room in the jostled <br>
    street And grass for carpet to my feet. <br>
    To sing me from my office <br>
    walls. All that I can see <br>
    I carry off with me. <br>
    But you never miss my theft, <br> 
    So much treasure you have <br> 
    left. As I find you, fresh at <br> 
    morning, So I find you, home <br> 
    returning -- <br>
    Nothing lacking from your  <br>
    grace. All your riches wait in  <br>
    place <br>
    For me to  <br>
    borrow On the <br>
    morrow. <br>
    Do you hear this praise of  <br>
    you, Little park that I pass  <br>
    through? <br>
