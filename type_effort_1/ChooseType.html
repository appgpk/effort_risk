  You must choose which of two types you want to be: <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>.
  For whichever type you choose, you will need to complete a short task to become that type.
</p>

 <p>
  In each period, your earnings will depend on your effort, your type, and a random draw that determines
  a multiplier for your type. The multiplier will either be <strong>1</strong> or <strong>1/3</strong>.
  Your points will be your effort times the multiplier.
</p>

 <p>
  For example, if your effort is <strong>300</strong>, you will receive either
  <strong>300 × 1 = 300</strong> or <strong>300 × 1/3 = 100</strong> points, depending on the random draw.
  For each <strong>300</strong> points you receive <strong>$2.50</strong>.
</p>

 <p>
  The multiplier depends on whether the computer draws a <strong>black</strong> or a <strong>white</strong> ball from a bag.
  The bag contains <strong>3 white balls</strong> and <strong>3 black balls</strong>.
</p>

 <ul>
  <li>
    If the computer draws a <strong>black</strong> ball, the multiplier is <strong>1</strong> for <strong>Type A</strong>
    and <strong>1/3</strong> for <strong>Type B</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the computer draws a <strong>white</strong> ball, the multiplier is <strong>1/3</strong> for <strong>Type A</strong>
    and <strong>1</strong> for <strong>Type B</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

 <p>
  Your effort depends on your performance in a simple math task. Each period, you will be asked to add pairs
  of numbers for <strong>3 minutes</strong>. For each sum you correctly add, your effort will increase by
  <strong>25</strong>. For example, if you correctly add <strong>12</strong> pairs of numbers, your effort will be
  <strong>12 × 25 = 300</strong>.
